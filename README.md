**Abstract:** This paper addresses the optimization of transport logistics in reforestation projects, focusing on minimizing time, hence, costs associated with the delivery of plants to reforestation sites. Using a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) framework, we applied mixed-integer linear programming to identify the optimal routes for delivery trucks, considering vehicle capacities and delivery demands. A heuristic solution was implemented, reducing computational time while maintainin near-optimal results. The solution, based on data from the National Forestry Commision in Mexico, shows that the heuristic model offers and efficient approach to managing reforestation logistics.
